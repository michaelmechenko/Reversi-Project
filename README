Final Project for EECE2140

Game Overview

Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8 ×8 uncheckered board.
There are 64 identical game pieces called disks, which are light on one side and dark on the
other.

The game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the board, two facing
light-up, and the other two with the dark side up (see Figure 1). The dark player makes the
first move.

Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. Each
player must place a disk in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal) line between the new disk and another of her disks, with one or more
opponent’s disks between them. After placing the disk, the player turns over (flips, captures)
all the opponent’s disks lying on a straight line between the new disk and any of her disks.

If one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When
neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the board has filled up, or when
one player has no more disks on the board. The player with more disks on the board at the
end wins.
